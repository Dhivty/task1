                Defending champions Chennai Super Kings will host Royal Challengers Bangalore at the MA Chidambaram Stadium in the opening match
                 of IPL 2024 on March 22.On Thursday, the IPL released a partial schedule comprising an initial set of 21 matches between March 22
                 and April 7. The IPL final is expected to be played on May 26, with just five days between that and the opening match of the men's
                 T20 World Cup, to be played in the USA and the Caribbean from June 1.
                The second half of the tournament schedule is expected once the Election Commission of India reveals the dates of the national
                 elections, which are expected to take place in the months of April and May.
                The opening match of the tournament will start at 8pm IST, while the remaining matches will follow the usual routine: 7.30pm IST
                 for evening games and, on days featuring double-headers, 3.30pm IST for the early game.There are four double-headers in the initial schedule including two on opening weekend. On March 23 Punjab Kings will play the day match against Delhi Capitals at home followed by Kolkata Knight Riders hosting Sunrisers Hyderabad at Eden Gardens.
                On March 24, Rajasthan Royals play their first game against Lucknow Super Giants while Hardik Pandya's Mumbai Indians open with an
                 away-fixture against Gujarat Titans, his former team. For the fourth time in six editions, the season opener will not feature both the finalists from the previous season, with last year's runners-up Titans kickstarting their campaign two days later.
                Two teams - Punjab Kings and Titans - will be playing back-to-back matches with just a day's break in the initial set of games.
                 After their first match, at home, on March 23, Punjab Kings will travel to Bengaluru to play RCB on March 25. Titans,
                  who will be led by Shubman Gill after Hardik's move to Mumbai Indians, will dash to Chennai a day after their tournament opener on March 24 to play CSK on March 26.</p>
